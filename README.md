[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b9656590-c23d-45d6-8ac6-515b643bc482/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/internsguide/deploys)

A un-official guide for upcoming interns for any company. 

## What is this?

This is a site I created in order to have a nice compilation of all the cool guides for interns are starting in new companies, most of the questions you as an intern have,probably have been answered by someone else before you got to the company you are interning at. 

This said, you shouldn't put things here that are meant to be internal.

## Contributing

Make sure you have [hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing), then create a PR by forking the code. 

Once installed, you just have to do

> hugo serve

In order to see your changes locally.
