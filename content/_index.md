# Interns.guide

## What is this?

This is a site I created in order to have a nice compilation of all the cool guides for interns that are starting in new companies, most of the questions you as an intern have, probably have been answered by someone else before you got to the company you are interning at. 

This said, you shouldn't put things here that are meant to be internal.

Click the links to the side to each one of the guides for interns that have decided to put their content here. 

## Why?

I was an intern three times myself, and I know that it is a time plagued with uncertainty. I know that a good information is the difference between a lot of experiences being fun or not in an internship. 

## Contributing

This is an open source guide, feel free to make a pull request with content, or raise an issue with what you need.

Please contribute your companies' tips and tricks for interns, this is a public github repo. File a PR or file an issue and I'll be happy to accept it.
