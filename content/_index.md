# Interns.guide

## What is this?

This is a site I created in order to have a nice compilation of all the cool guides for interns that are starting in new companies, most of the questions you as an intern have, probably have been answered by someone else before you got to the company you are interning at. 

This said, you shouldn't put things here that are meant to be internal.

Click the links to the side to each one of the guides for interns that have decided to put their content here. 

## Contributing

Please contribute your companies' tips and tricks for interns, this is a public github repo. File a PR or file an issue and I'll be happy to accept it.
